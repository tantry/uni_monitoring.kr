CONTINUATION FROM PREVIOUS CHAT - UNIVERSITY ADMISSION MONITOR

User is frustrated with AI jumping ahead without waiting for results. Key issues:
1. Telegram configuration works (bot token: 8537135583..., chat ID: 440747849)
2. Links from scraper are broken or point to privacy policy pages (prtlBbsId URLs)
3. Adiga.kr real admission content not found - only privacy pages at noticeDetail.do URLs
4. User has many duplicate scraper files from previous failed attempts

User instructions for AI:
- WAIT FOR TEST RESULTS before suggesting next steps
- Give ONE command at a time
- No guessing or anticipating
- Work only with actual data provided

Current problem: Scraper finds broken links, needs to find real admission announcements

DO NOT jump ahead. Wait for user to provide current scraper output before suggesting anything.
