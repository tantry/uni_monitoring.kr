I've created a comprehensive future project plan that includes:

## **What's in the FUTURE_PROJECTS.md file:**

1. **Complete roadmap** for multi-site aggregation
2. **5 target sites** with specific features to monitor
3. **Technical architecture** with database design
4. **Module structure** for scalable development
5. **Implementation roadmap** with 5 phases
6. **Challenges and solutions**
7. **Priority features** categorized
8. **Technology stack** recommendations
9. **Success metrics** to track
10. **Quick start guide** for when you're ready

## **Next Steps for Current Project:**

1. First, let's fix the Adiga link issue (Phase 2)
2. Then set up systemd/cron for automation (Phase 3)
3. When ready, refer to `FUTURE_PROJECTS.md` to start Phase 4

## **To view the plan:**

```bash
cd ~/uni_monitoring
