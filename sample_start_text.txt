Working on University Admission Monitor system.
scrapes a site for announcements alerts to telegram channel
GitHub: https://github.com/tantry/uni_monitoring.kr

1. start by examining the README.md
2. provide fresh script after checking the github for my current files
3. prefer cat command to write completely new file instead of manual search and replace lines
Current Status: Telegram alerts not going through to telegram channel
4. VERY IMPORTANTLY: wait for my response when issuing troubleshooting or stteps to implement. do not work on hypotheticals,. do not get ahead of the user
5. Give the solutions that ensure long standing good architecture for addition of new scrapers, retaining testers of sites or sound logical structure of processs (i.e. don't even bother with the quick one liner solutions. the user wants a robust working solution)
