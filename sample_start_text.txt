start by examining the README.md
please give me solutions step by step... only one step, then we test, waait for fix confirm then proceed

Current Status: Telegram alerts not going through
Most Likely Issues:

    config.py has wrong variable names (should be CHAT_ID not CHANNEL_ID)

    No real BOT_TOKEN/CHAT_ID set yet

    Test programs filtered as duplicates
so you wrote fix_telegram.py --
this was the readout:multi_monitor.py expects: CHAT_ID
multi_monitor.py expects: CHANNEL_ID
config.py has: CHANNEL_ID
config.py has: BOT_TOKEN
