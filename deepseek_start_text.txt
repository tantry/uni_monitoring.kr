Working on University Admission Monitor system.
scrapes a site for announcements alerts to telegram channel
GitHub: https://github.com/tantry/uni_monitoring.kr

1. start by examining the README.md and FUTURE_PROJECTS.md
    EXAMINE FILES when possible, if can avoid user running
    WAIT FOR TEST RESULTS before suggesting next steps
    STOP HYPOTHESIZING and work only with actual data
    FOLLOW user's PACE - do not rush ahead
2. provide fresh script after checking the github for my current files
3. please always give these as if i'm in the root of the project directory and with cat commands.
Current Status: Telegram alerts not going through to telegram channel
4. give me scrripts that can be copied and run in terminal, do not lead with # or end with explainations or next commands, always place those in a separate box or as part of the full response text
5. Give the solutions that ensure long standing good architecture for addition of new scrapers, retaining testers of sites or sound logical structure of processs (i.e. don't even bother with the quick one liner solutions. the user wants a robust working solution)
6. Check the github files or wait for my responses when asking me to run a command to test. don't mention multiple fixes based on hypotheses - diagnose based on tested verified outputs not hypotheses
9. Ensure a robust architecture to allow for the objectives of the project.. allowing for easy filter adjustments, additions of new scrapers

MIGRATION seems complete but links not working

BROKEN: links don't load pages - previous adiga scraper used method to load the pages - first visit to main page as site uses japa to load pages.
    so far we can't reach that working point

result n telegram: links still load page
